title: What happens to diffusion model likelihood when your model is conditional?
abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) iteratively denoise random samples to produce high-quality
  data. The iterative sampling process is derived from Stochastic Differential Equations
  (SDEs), allowing a speed-quality trade-off chosen at inference. Another advantage
  of sampling with differential equations is exact likelihood computation. These likelihoods
  have been used to rank unconditional DMs and for out-of-domain classification. Despite
  the many existing and possible uses of DM likelihoods, the distinct properties captured
  are unknown, especially in conditional contexts such as Text-To-Image (TTI) or Text-To-Speech
  synthesis (TTS). Surprisingly, we find that TTS DM likelihoods are agnostic to the
  text input. TTI likelihood is more expressive but cannot discern confounding prompts.
  Our results show that applying DMs to conditional tasks reveals inconsistencies
  and strengthens claims that the properties of DM likelihood are unknown. This impact
  sheds light on the previously unknown nature of DM likelihoods. Although conditional
  DMs maximise likelihood, the likelihood in question is not as sensitive to the conditioning
  input as one expects. This investigation provides a new point-of-view on diffusion
  likelihoods.
