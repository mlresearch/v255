title: 'PINNtegrate: PINN-based Integral-Learning for Variational and Interface Problems'
abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) feature applications to various
  partial differential equations (PDEs) in physics and engineering. Many real-world
  problems contain interfaces, i.e., discontinuities in some model parameter, and
  have to be included in any relevant PDE solver toolkit. These problems do not necessarily
  admit smooth solutions. Therefore, interfaces cannot be naturally included into
  classical PINNs, since their learning algorithm uses the strong formulation of the
  PDE and does not include solutions in the weak sense. The interface information
  can be incorporated either by an additional flux condition on the interface or by
  a variational formulation, thus also allowing weak solutions. This paper proposes
  new approaches to combine either the weak or energy functional formulation with
  the piece-wise strong formulation, to be able to tackle interface problems. Our
  new method PINNtegrate can incorporate integrals into the neural network learning
  algorithm. This novel method cannot only be applied to interface problems but also
  to other problems that contain an integrand as an optimization objective. We demonstrate
  PINNtegrate on variational minimal surface and interface problems of linear elliptic
  PDEs.
