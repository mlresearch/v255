title: A Neural Ordinary Differential Equations Approach for 2D Flow Properties Analysis
  of Hydraulic Structures
abstract: 'In hydraulic engineering, the design and optimization of weir structures
  play a critical role in the management of river systems. Weirs must efficiently
  manage high flow rates while maintaining low overfall heights and predictable flow
  behavior. Determining upstream flow depths and discharge coefficients requires costly
  and time-consuming physical experiments or numerical simulations. Neural Ordinary
  Differential Equations (NODE) can be capable of predicting these flow features and
  reducing the effort of generating experimental and numerical data. We propose a
  simulation based 2D dataset of flow properties upstream of weir structures called
  FlowProp. In a second step we use a NODE-based approach to analyze flow behavior
  as well as discharge coefficients for various geometries. In the evaluation process,
  it is evident that the aforementioned approach is effective in describing the headwater,
  overfall height and tailwater.The approach is further capable of predicting the
  flow behavior of geometries beyond the training data. Project page and code: https://github.com/SEilermann/FlowProp'
