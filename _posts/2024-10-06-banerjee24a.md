title: 'EMILY: Extracting sparse Model from ImpLicit dYnamics'
abstract: Sparse model recovery requires us to extract model coefficients of ordinary
  differential equations (ODE) with few nonlinear terms from data. This problem has
  been effectively solved in recent literature for the case when all state variables
  of the ODE are measured. In practical deployments, measurements of all the state
  variables of the underlying ODE model of a process are not available, resulting
  in implicit (unmeasured) dynamics. In this paper, we propose EMILY, that can extract
  the underlying ODE of a dynamical process even if much of the dynamics is implicit.
  We show the utility of EMILY on four baseline examples and compare with the state-of-the-art
  techniques such as SINDY-MPC. Results show that unlike SINDY-MPC, EMILY can recover
  model coefficients accurately under implicit dynamics.
