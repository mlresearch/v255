title: Time and State Dependent Neural Delay Differential Equations
abstract: Discontinuities and delayed terms are encountered in the governing equations
  of a large class of problems ranging from physics and engineering to medicine and
  economics. These systems cannot be properly modelled and simulated with standard
  Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), or data-driven approximations such as Neural
  Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE). To circumvent this issue, latent variables
  are typically introduced to solve the dynamics of the system in a higher dimensional
  space and obtain the solution as a projection to the original space. However, this
  solution lacks physical interpretability. In contrast, Delay Differential Equations
  (DDEs), and their data-driven approximated counterparts, naturally appear as good
  candidates to characterize such systems. In this work we revisit the recently proposed
  Neural DDE by introducing Neural State-Dependent DDE (SDDDE), a general and flexible
  framework that can model multiple and state- and time-dependent delays. We show
  that our method is competitive and outperforms other continuous-class models on
  a wide variety of delayed dynamical systems. Code is available at the repository
