title: Optimal Control of a Coastal Ecosystem Through Neural Ordinary Differential
  Equations
abstract: Optimal control problems (OCPs) are essentials in various domains such as
  science, engineering, and industry, requiring the optimisation of control variables
  for dynamic systems, along with the corresponding state variables, that minimise
  a given performance index. Traditional methods for solving OCPs often rely on numerical
  techniques and can be computationally expensive when the discretisation grid or
  time horizon changes. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages
  Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to model the dynamics of control
  variables in OCPs. By embedding Neural ODEs within the optimisation problem, we
  effectively address the limitations of traditional methods, eliminating the need
  to re-solve the OCP under different discretisation schemes. We apply this method
  to a coastal ecosystem OCP, demonstrating its efficacy in solving the problem over
  a 50-year horizon and extending predictions up to 70 years without re-solve the
  optimisation problem.
