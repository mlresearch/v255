title: Neural-based models ensemble for identification of the vibrating beam system
abstract: 'The paper provides an effective machine learning-based approach to model
  design and implementation for the transverse vibrations of the actuated cantilever
  beam under the regime of nonlinear loads. In particular, the problems of reconstruction
  of non-linear actuation and dynamics of the beam are separately covered based on
  available measurement data. Little is expected from input sequences, except for
  application-required spectral coverage. The idea is to decompose the whole system
  into a serial connection of a static non-linear subsystem representing electromagnetic
  actuation with inherent built-in magnetic hysteresis and a non-linear dynamic subsystem
  approximating the spatio-temporal dynamics of the vibrating beam. Then, both components
  can be independently modeled in terms of dedicated neural networks: static feedforward
  network with augmented inputs providing the information on the signal gradient for
  the first subsystem and the multimodel neural ensemble with dedicated data fusion
  rule for the latter. In this context, a novel method is proposed here, where all
  candidate models are evaluated first using historical data, and based on achieved
  results, a proper weight is assigned to each model pointing out its contribution
  to the final response of the model. Each candidate model was designed using a recurrent
  neural network. The proposed approach provides great flexibility in model design,
  leading to a very high accuracy of system state estimation. In addition, the networks
  to be used have at most two layers with internal feedback loops, offering competitively
  attractive complexity. The advantage of this data-driven machine learning scheme
  is that incomplete knowledge of the physical model can be efficiently recovered
  or exchanged with the properly gathered information from input-output measurements.
  A physically relevant real-world application is given to illustrate the potential
  of the new design in the form of dynamic displacement modeling for an actuated vibrating
  beam system.'
