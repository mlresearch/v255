title: Optimising Neural Fractional Differential Equations for Performance and Efficiency
abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) are well-established architectures
  that fit an ODE, modelled by a neural network (NN), to data, effectively modelling
  complex dynamical systems. Recently, Neural Fractional Differential Equations (NFDEs)
  were proposed, inspired by NODEs, to incorporate non-integer order differential
  equations, capturing memory effects and long-range dependencies. In this work, we
  present an optimised implementation of the NFDE solver, achieving up to 570 times
  faster computations and up to 79 times higher accuracy. Additionally, the solver
  supports efficient multidimensional computations and batch processing. Furthermore,
  we enhance the experimental design to ensure a fair comparison of NODEs and NFDEs
  by implementing rigorous hyperparameter tuning and using consistent numerical methods.
  Our results demonstrate that for systems exhibiting fractional dynamics, NFDEs significantly
  outperform NODEs, particularly in extrapolation tasks on unseen time horizons. Although
  NODEs can learn fractional dynamics when time is included as a feature to the NN,
  they encounter difficulties in extrapolation due to reliance on explicit time dependence.
