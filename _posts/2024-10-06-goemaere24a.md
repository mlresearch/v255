title: 'Accelerating Hopfield Network Dynamics: Beyond Synchronous Updates and Forward
  Euler'
abstract: The Hopfield network serves as a fundamental energy-based model in machine
  learning, capturing memory retrieval dynamics through an ordinary differential equation
  (ODE). The model’s output, the equilibrium point of the ODE, is traditionally computed
  via synchronous updates using the forward Euler method. This paper aims to overcome
  some of the disadvantages of this approach. We propose a conceptual shift, viewing
  Hopfield networks as instances of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs). The DEQ framework
  not only allows for the use of specialized solvers, but also leads to new insights
  on an empirical inference technique that we will refer to as ’even-odd splitting’.
  Our theoretical analysis of the method uncovers a parallelizable asynchronous update
  scheme, which should converge roughly twice as fast as the conventional synchronous
  updates. Empirical evaluations validate these findings, showcasing the advantages
  of both the DEQ framework and even-odd splitting in digitally simulating energy
  minimization in Hopfield networks. The code is available at https://github.com/cgoemaere/hopdeq.
